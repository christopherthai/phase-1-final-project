# User Stories
As an user, I want a song that will match my mood for the day. I’ll hit the website, enter my location and get the weather forecast for today. I am giving a song of the day to listen to based on the weather of my location. I can favorite the song which will add it on the “Favorite” Playlist.

# API
Weather API:

https://open-meteo.com/ 

# 3 Unique Event Listeners
1. submit - Add a 'submit' event listener when submitting the location
2. click - Add a 'click' event listener when you click the like button on the song
3. mouseover - Add a 'mouseover' event listener when hovering over the song button that will highlight it

# Array Iteration
We will use the forEach method to iterate through the data that we fetch from the json server to find the song base on the weather.

# Three Strech Goals
1. Be able to change the mood
2. Show the 7 days forecast
3. Add your own songs to the song database
